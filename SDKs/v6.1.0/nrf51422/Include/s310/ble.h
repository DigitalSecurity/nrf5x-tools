/**@brief Get an event from the pending events queue.
 *
 * @param[in] p_dest Pointer to buffer to be filled in with an event, or NULL to retrieve the event length. This buffer <b>must be 4-byte aligned in memory</b>.
 * @param[in, out] p_len Pointer the length of the buffer, on return it is filled with the event length.
 *
 * @details This call allows the application to pull a BLE event from the BLE stack. The application is signalled that an event is 
 * available from the BLE Stack by the triggering of the SD_EVT_IRQn interrupt (mapped to IRQ 22).
 * The application is free to choose whether to call this function from thread mode (main context) or directly from the Interrupt Service Routine
 * that maps to SD_EVT_IRQn. In any case however, and because the BLE stack runs at a higher priority than the application, this function should be called
 * in a loop (until @ref NRF_ERROR_NOT_FOUND is returned) every time SD_EVT_IRQn is raised to ensure that all available events are pulled from the stack. 
 * Failure to do so could potentially leave events in the internal queue without the application being aware of this fact.
 * Sizing the p_dest buffer is equally important, since the application needs to provide all the memory necessary for the event to be copied into
 * application memory. If the buffer provided is not large enough to fit the entire contents of the event, @ref NRF_ERROR_DATA_SIZE will be returned
 * and the application can then call again with a larger buffer size.
 * Please note that because of the variable length nature of some events, sizeof(ble_evt_t) will not always be large enough to fit certain events, 
 * and so it is the application's responsability to provide an amount of memory large enough so that the relevant event is copied in full.
 * The application may "peek" the event length by providing p_dest as a NULL pointer and inspecting the value of *p_len upon return.
 *
 * @note The pointer supplied must be aligned to the extend defined by @ref BLE_EVTS_PTR_ALIGNMENT
 *
 * @return @ref NRF_SUCCESS Event pulled and stored into the supplied buffer.
 * @return @ref NRF_ERROR_INVALID_ADDR Invalid or not sufficiently aligned pointer supplied.

/**@brief Get the total number of available application transmission buffers in the BLE stack.
 *
 * @details This call allows the application to obtain the total number of
 *          transmission buffers available for application data. Please note that
 *          this does not give the number of free buffers, but rather the total amount of them.
 *          The application has two options to handle its own application transmission buffers:
 *          - Use a simple arithmetic calculation: at boot time the application should use this function
 *          to find out the total amount of buffers available to it and store it in a variable.
 *          Every time a packet that consumes an application buffer is sent using any of the 
 *          exposed functions in this BLE API, the application should decrement that variable.
 *          Conversely, whenever a @ref BLE_EVT_TX_COMPLETE event is received by the application
 *          it should retrieve the count field in such event and add that number to the same
 *          variable storing the number of available packets.
 *          This mechanism allows the application to be aware at any time of the number of
 *          application packets available in the BLE stack's internal buffers, and therefore
 *          it can know with certainty whether it is possible to send more data or it has to
 *          wait for a @ref BLE_EVT_TX_COMPLETE event before it proceeds.
 *          - Choose to simply not keep track of available buffers at all, and instead handle the 
 *          @ref BLE_ERROR_NO_TX_BUFFERS error by queueing the packet to be transmitted and 
 *          try again as soon as a @ref BLE_EVT_TX_COMPLETE event arrives.

 *          the parameters supplied to them can be found below:

 *                     successful return.

/**@brief Add a Vendor Specific UUID.
 *
 * @details This call enables the application to add a vendor specific UUID to the BLE stack's table,
 *          for later use all other modules and APIs. This then allows the application to use the shorter,
 *          24-bit @ref ble_uuid_t format when dealing with both 16-bit and 128-bit UUIDs without having to
 *          check for lengths and having split code paths. The way that this is accomplished is by extending the 
 *          grouping mechanism that the Bluetooth SIG standard base UUID uses for all other 128-bit UUIDs. The 
 *          type field in the @ref ble_uuid_t structure is an index (relative to @ref BLE_UUID_TYPE_VENDOR_BEGIN) 
 *          to the table populated by multiple calls to this function, and the uuid field in the same structure 
 *          contains the 2 bytes at indices 12 and 13. The number of possible 128-bit UUIDs available to the 
 *          application is therefore the number of Vendor Specific UUIDs added with the help of this function times 65536, 
 *          although restricted to modifying bytes 12 and 13 for each of the entries in the supplied array.
