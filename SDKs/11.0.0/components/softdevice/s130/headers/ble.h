 * The application is free to choose whether to call this function from thread mode (main context) or directly from the

 * priority than the application, this function should be called in a loop (until @ref NRF_ERROR_NOT_FOUND is returned)
 * every time SD_EVT_IRQn is raised to ensure that all available events are pulled from the BLE stack. Failure to do so
 * could potentially leave events in the internal queue without the application being aware of this fact. Sizing the

 *
 * @details This call allows the application to obtain the total number of guaranteed application transmission packets
 * available for a connection. Please note that this does not return the number of free packets, but rather the total
 * amount of them for that particular connection. The application has two options to handle transmitting application packets:
 * - Use a simple arithmetic calculation: after connection creation time the application should use this function to
 * find out the total amount of guaranteed packets available to it and store it in a variable.
 * Every time a packet is successfully queued for a transmission on this connection using any of the exposed functions in
 * this  BLE API, the application should decrement that variable. Conversely, whenever a @ref BLE_EVT_TX_COMPLETE event
 * with the conn_handle matching the particular connection is received by the application, it should retrieve the count
 * field in such event and add that number to the same variable storing the number of available guaranteed packets. This
 * mechanism allows the application to be aware at any time of the number of guaranteed application packets available for
 * each of the active connections, and therefore it can know with certainty whether it is possible to send more data or
 * it has to wait for a @ref BLE_EVT_TX_COMPLETE event before it proceeds.
 * The application can still pursue transmissions when the number of guaranteed application packets available is smaller
 * than or equal to zero, but successful queuing of the tranmsission is not guaranteed.
 * - Choose to simply not keep track of available packets at all, and instead handle the @ref BLE_ERROR_NO_TX_PACKETS error
 * by queueing the packet to be transmitted and try again as soon as a @ref BLE_EVT_TX_COMPLETE event arrives.
 *

/**@brief Add a Vendor Specific UUID.
 *
 * @details This call enables the application to add a vendor specific UUID to the BLE stack's table, for later use
 * all other modules and APIs. This then allows the application to use the shorter, 24-bit @ref ble_uuid_t format
 * when dealing with both 16-bit and 128-bit UUIDs without having to check for lengths and having split code paths.
 * The way that this is accomplished is by extending the grouping mechanism that the Bluetooth SIG standard base
 * UUID uses for all other 128-bit UUIDs. The type field in the @ref ble_uuid_t structure is an index (relative to
 * @ref BLE_UUID_TYPE_VENDOR_BEGIN) to the table populated by multiple calls to this function, and the uuid field
 * in the same structure contains the 2 bytes at indices 12 and 13. The number of possible 128-bit UUIDs available to
 * the application is therefore the number of Vendor Specific UUIDs added with the help of this function times 65536,
 * although restricted to modifying bytes 12 and 13 for each of the entries in the supplied array.
 *
